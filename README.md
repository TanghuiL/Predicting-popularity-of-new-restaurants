**Predicting the popularity of a new restaurant using Yelp dataset**

Every restaurant owner wants to know whether it can succeed when opening a new restaurant. To this end, understanding what contributes to an existing restaurant’s success would certainly provide much insights to secure a new venue’s own success. 

Among all the platforms for choosing a place to eat, Yelp is one of the most popular apps. For restaurants, the Yelp star rating indicates the food quality and service of restaurants. High star ratings on Yelp show that the restaurant provides quality food and services, which means more people are visiting or attracted to the restaurant. Given this consideration, the star rating is a good indicator for restaurant’s popularity and hence success. 

This project, therefore, aims model the star rating of restaurants listed on Yelp using the Yelp Challenge dataset.  Specifically, I would like to predict star ratings of restaurants on Yelp as an index of popularity based on restaurant features, including venue location, price range, services, opening hours, review etc. This project intends to shed lights on what customers value the most about a restaurant, hence to provide suggestions on what should a business owner consider when opening a new restaurant to optimize the potential for success . 

Dataset:

The data comes from Yelp Dataset Challenge.  The dataset contains restaurant information such as location, opening hours, price level, food type, service provided etc. It also has review data available, including the review text, time and rating. 

Modeling:

Various machine learning methods, including Naive Bayes, logistic regression, RandomForest, SVM, and Neural Network,  were employed to build an ensemble predictive model.
